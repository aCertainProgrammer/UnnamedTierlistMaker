CURRENT WORK:

THEN:

SHORT IDEAS:

- Tierlist export image

- Tierlist snapshots

- Tierlist export all snaphots as images

- Champion preview instead of dummy

- Moving tiers not with arrows but by dragging?

LONG IDEAS:

BUGS:

- champions overflow tiers on small resolutions

NOTES:

- When swapping tiers I just swap the viewmodels around - might be a problem when saving/loading depending on what happens to the models
